## üß≠ Onboarding Module

The onboarding process is the bridge between account creation and profile activation. It ensures that all Blink users begin their journey with a thoughtful and emotionally safe setup that reflects their identity, preferences, and expectations.

Onboarding is triggered **immediately after first login** and is **mandatory** before access to the rest of the app is granted.

---

### üß± Onboarding Structure

The onboarding consists of **two main phases**, designed to progressively enrich the user's profile while preserving flexibility and user agency.

---

### üìã Phase 1 ‚Äî Basic Form (Required)

This fixed form gathers essential data for all new users. It ensures every profile contains the minimum viable information for compatibility and safety.

**Fields:**

| Field                | Type          | Notes                                                       |
|---------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name                | Text          | First name only, validated for length and characters        |
| Date of Birth       | Date Picker   | Must be 18 or older, age is calculated and stored           |
| Gender              | Select        | Options: `man`, `woman`, `non-binary/other`                |
| Orientation         | Multi-select  | What the user is looking for: `men`, `women`, `everyone`    |
| Location            | Geolocation   | Retrieved via client-side API or manual selection           |
| Photos              | Uploader      | Minimum 1, up to 6, blurred by default, revealed gradually  |

**Technical Notes:**

- Data is saved via `POST /onboarding/basic-profile`
- Location uses reverse geocoding to store city and coordinates
- Blurring logic is enforced at the media layer, not client-side

---

### üß† Phase 2 ‚Äî Interests & Description (Optional Pathways)

After completing the form, users are invited to **enrich their profile** with personality-revealing content. This step supports **two modes**:

---

#### üìù Manual Completion

Users fill out:

- **About Me**: Free-text bio  
- **Hobbies & Interests**: Tag-based selector  
- **Looking For**: Values, intentions, priorities  
- **Dealbreakers**: Optional red flags or preferences  

**Endpoint:**  
`POST /onboarding/manual-profile`

---

#### ü§ñ Conversational Agent (AI Mode)

Users engage with an **interactive agent** (chatbot-style) that helps them describe:

- Personality traits  
- Life philosophy  
- Relationship expectations  
- Humor, lifestyle, quirks  
- Short profile bio (auto-generated + editable)

**Functionality:**

- Agent uses NLP to infer key traits from conversation  
- Generates initial values for interests and profile description  
- User can approve, modify, or restart this process  

**Endpoint:**  
`POST /onboarding/ai-profile`

**Backend Behavior:**

- Uses OpenAI-like model (e.g. GPT) for intent & tone analysis  
- Suggestions are stored as editable drafts  
- Agent supports fallback to manual at any time

---

### üõ† Developer Notes

- Onboarding status is stored in the `users` table under `onboarding_complete: boolean`
- Users are locked out of match/discovery flows until onboarding is marked complete
- Conversational agent data is stored in a temporary `draft_profile` table before confirmation
- Photo blurring state is handled via metadata (`is_blurred: true`) per image
